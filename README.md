How the project started: <b>
I love playing this gmame on my phone. However, the app that I use has too many ads everywhere and I could not play the game back to back as there would be ads poping up after every game for a good minute. With the creation of this, I am able to play without interuptions :)

Close the Box Game: Overview and Instructions

Game Objective
Close the Box is a traditional dice game where the goal is to "close" all the numbers on a board (1 to 9) by rolling two dice and using their sum to eliminate numbers. The game ends when a player can no longer make a valid move.

Setup
The game board consists of numbers from 1 to 9, all initially open (represented as available) and 2 six-sided dice are used to determine the moves.

How to Play
1. Roll the two dice. The sum of the dice will determine how you can close numbers on the board.
2. After rolling, calculate the total of the two dice.
3. Choose any combination of numbers that sum to the total.
   For example, if you roll a total of 7, you could choose (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), or (7).
4. The combination of number entered will be displayed as 'X'. 
5. Continue Playing: After making a move, roll the dice again and repeat the process until:
   - You can no longer make a valid move (if no combinations of available numbers match the total rolled).
   - All numbers are shut, in which case you win the game!
   
Ending the Game
1. If you cannot make a valid move, the game is over. Your score is calculated by summing all remaining open numbers on the board.
2. If you manage to shut all numbers, you win and are congratulated for "shutting the box!"

Strategy Tips!
- Plan your moves carefully to maximize the numbers you can shut. 
- Consider which numbers are left on the board as the game progresses to avoid leaving high-value numbers that could hinder future moves.

Conclusion
Shut the Box is a game of chance and strategy that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. It fosters critical thinking and decision-making skills while providing a fun and engaging experience. Enjoy playing and may the best strategist win!

<h2><b> How the project started </b></h2>
I love playing close the box (alternative name: shut the box) on my phone. However, the app that I use has too many ads everywhere and I could not play the game back to back as there would be ads poping up after every game for a good minute. With the creation of this, I am able to play without interuptions :)
</p>

<h2><b>Close the Box Game: Overview and Instructions</b></h2>
<p>
<h3><b>Game Objective</b></h3>
Close the Box is a traditional dice game where the goal is to "close" all the numbers on a board (1 to 9) by rolling two dice and using their sum to eliminate numbers. The game ends when a player can no longer make a valid move.
</p>

<p>
<h3><b> Setup </b></h3>
The game board consists of numbers from 1 to 9, all initially open (represented as available) and 2 six-sided dice are used to determine the moves.
</p>

<p>
<h3><b> How to Play </b></h3>
1. Roll the two dice. The sum of the dice will determine how you can close numbers on the board. <br>
2. After rolling, calculate the total of the two dice. <br>
3. Choose any combination of numbers that sum to the total. <br>
   For example, if you roll a total of 7, you could choose (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), or (7). <br>
4. The combination of number entered will be displayed as 'X'. <br>
5. Continue Playing: After making a move, roll the dice again and repeat the process until: <br>
   - You can no longer make a valid move (if no combinations of available numbers match the total rolled). <br>
   - All numbers are shut, in which case you win the game!
</p>
<p>
<h3><b> Ending the Game</b></h3>
1. If you cannot make a valid move, the game is over. Your score is calculated by summing all remaining open numbers on the board. <br>
2. If you manage to shut all numbers, you win and are congratulated for "shutting the box!"
</p>

<p>
<h3><b>Strategy Tips!</b></h3>
1. Plan your moves carefully to maximize the numbers you can shut. <br>
2. Consider which numbers are left on the board as the game progresses to avoid leaving high-value numbers that could hinder future moves.
</p>
<p>
<h3><b> Conclusion </b></h3>
Shut the Box is a game of chance and strategy that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. It fosters critical thinking and decision-making skills while providing a fun and engaging experience. Enjoy playing and may the best strategist win!

<h6> * I called it "Shut the box" but changed it to Close the box <br> * "Close" and "Shut" refers to the same thing, closing the number from the box <br> * "Board" is used to refer to the numbers available/all the numbers <br> * "Tiles" refer to the numbers 1 to 9
